I'm a second-year M.S. student in Bioengineering at UCLA, advised by Dr. Anne Churchland. I use computational techniques to study the dynamics of corticostriatal circuits supporting differential decision-making strategies across aging. I also think the word 'dynamics' is overused in computational neuroscience, though I certainly recognize that I am part of the problem.

I love to learn about all things neuroscience, computers, and (pure) math. Please reach out if you'd like to chat about those topics or otherwise!
