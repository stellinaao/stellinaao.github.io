My education has cultivated a habit of reading broadly and voraciously. I enjoy public-facing science writing, am catching up on classic twentieth-century literature, and seek out novels that make me laugh on one page and sit with uncomfortable ideas on the next.

I tend to keep multiple volumes in rotation, spanning a diverse array of subjects. This habit creates an environment conducive to cross-fertilization of thought, and often results in a reading list as long as the set I have finished that year. I’m always happy to exchange thoughts on any of these books.
