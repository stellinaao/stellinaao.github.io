As a teaching assistant for BE 175, I led twenty students in weekly two-hour discussions, reinforcing and extending core lecture content. I focused on drilling the high-level intuition for machine learning techniques that my students may encounter in their careers as bioengineers, from dynamical systems to Bayesian inference. I also prioritized conditioning good practices and grooves of skepticism such that, even if they don't understand the mathematics of a model they encounter in the workforce, they know how to probe and question it (i.e., always cross-validate!). Still, I liked to cover the mathematics underlying the techniques whenever time permitted and the math was sufficiently cool (e.g., the head-smacking plainness of Newton's method after introducing gradient descent, the kernel trick, etc.). 

The slide decks and Kahoots I constructed are available upon request, as are my comprehensive student evaluations.

After this experience, I am no longer a stranger to grading exams for cohorts approaching one hundred students. Glass half full or half empty; there is water in the glass.

BE 175 is an upper-division, required course for the Bioengineering degree, taught by Dr. Aaron Meyer.
