BE 177A: Bioengineering Capstone Design I (*Autumn 2025*)
======
As the teaching assistant for the computational track in the Bioengineering senior capstone, I was responsible for guiding four teams of five students as they ideated and built virtual cell models (e.g., predicting growth rates given drugs, transcriptional changes given CRISPRi KOs, etc.). I held weekly, two-hour office hours where I taught relevant concepts, suggested concrete packages and workflows, debugged code, and helped with interpretation. I also provided dense and specific feedback on practice presentations and proposals, focusing on honing scientific communication, grasp of core concepts, and the degree of creative innovation in each project.

BE 177A is the first course in the two-part senior capstone that all Bioengineering undergraduates at UCLA take to complete their degree. The computational track was led by Dr. Aaron Meyer.
