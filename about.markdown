Hello! I'm Stellina Ao, a Bioengineering M.S. student at UCLA. I'm interested in all things neuroscience, computers, and math.

Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing (ballet + Chinese classical), creative activities (painting, crocheting, etc.), and reading. I also enjoy spending time with my boisterous nine-year-old German Shepherd Flora.
